I need to implement a Queue data structure with three methods: `enqueue(x)` to add an element to the rear, `dequeue()` to remove an element from the front, and `getFront()` to return the element at the front without removing it. The critical constraint is that all three operations must have a time complexity of O(1).\n",

      "The code is mostly correct and efficient, achieving O(1) for the required operations. However, it needs improvement in a few areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Error Handling:** The `dequeue` and `getFront` methods return `None` when the queue is empty. While this is a valid approach, raising an exception (e.g., `IndexError` or a custom exception) would be more Pythonic and informative, signaling that an invalid operation was attempted. This is important for code robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **PEP 8 Compliance:** While generally good, there could be some minor PEP 8 improvements, such as adding a blank line after class docstrings (if they existed) and ensuring consistent spacing. More importantly, the provided justification block is not PEP8 compliant in terms of line length.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Completeness:** The prompt asked for enqueue, dequeue, and getFront which are all implemented in O(1). A `getSize` function was added for testing which is fine, but it wasn't explicitly asked for in the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation meets some requirements and falls short on others:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Code Correctness:** The core logic for enqueue, dequeue, and getFront appears correct, and the linked list implementation ensures proper queue behavior. The handling of empty queue conditions is present, although it could be improved with exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** All three specified operations (enqueue, dequeue, getFront) achieve O(1) time complexity, which satisfies the prompt's requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Adherence to Design Patterns:** The code uses a basic linked list structure to implement the queue, which is a common and appropriate design pattern for this task. No specific design patterns were mandated, so this aspect is satisfactory.\n",
