The most important pigment is chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color. Other pigments, like carotenoids (responsible for yellows and oranges), also contribute by absorbing different wavelengths of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **How it Works:** When light strikes a chlorophyll molecule, the light energy excites electrons within the molecule, boosting them to a higher energy level. This \"excited\" state is unstable, and the energy needs to be captured and converted.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Location:** This light absorption primarily happens in structures called light-harvesting complexes (also known as antenna complexes) within the thylakoid membranes inside the chloroplasts.\n",

      "    2 H₂O  →  4 H⁺ + 4 e⁻ + O₂\n",
      "\n",
      "    In other words: Two molecules of water are split into four protons (H+), four electrons (e-), and one molecule of oxygen (O₂).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why is water splitting so important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Electron Source:** The electrons released from water are essential! These electrons are used to replenish the electrons lost by chlorophyll in PSII when it absorbs light energy. Remember, chlorophyll *donates* electrons when it gets energized, and it needs to get those electrons back to continue the process.\n",
      "    *   **Proton Gradient:** The protons (H+) released contribute to a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This gradient is vital for ATP synthesis (we'll get to that in the next major phase).\n",
      "    *   **Oxygen Production:** Finally, and most famously, this process releases oxygen (O₂) as a byproduct! This is the oxygen we breathe and is the origin of all the oxygen in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Mechanism (simplified):** The OEC goes through a series of oxidation states (called the S-states, S0 to S4). Each time PSII absorbs light, the OEC advances to the next oxidation state by extracting one electron from the water molecule. After four light absorption events (and four electron extractions), the OEC reaches the S4 state, which is highly unstable. S4 then spontaneously splits water, releasing oxygen, protons, and returning the OEC to its initial S0 state, ready to start the cycle again.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:** Water splitting, driven by the energy captured by PSII, provides the electrons needed to keep photosynthesis running, creates a proton gradient for ATP production, and generates the oxygen that sustains life on Earth.\n",

In a circular queue implementation, when the queue is empty, `self.front` can be equal to `self.rear`. However, after the last element is dequeued, `self.front` becomes equal to `self.rear + 1` which might wrap around. Also `dequeue` does not reset rear when the last element is removed, leading to incorrect `is_empty` checks. Initial value of `rear` should be -1, so empty check should be when `self.front > self.rear` or when count of elements is 0.\n",

It uses a linked list, which is appropriate for achieving this time complexity. The code also generally follows PEP8 guidelines, although there's room for improvement in docstring formatting. However, there's a crucial detail missing: the prompt asked for a doubly linked list implementation, but this implementation only uses a singly linked list. Because a doubly linked list was specifically requested and not implemented, the solution fails to fully meet the original prompt's requirements.
